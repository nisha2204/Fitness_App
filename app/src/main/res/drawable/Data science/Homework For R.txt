				Homework For R

1] #Create one folder
#Create an R Script and write a code to initialise the variables l,m and n with your birthdate, month, and year. Then concate these 3 variables and save result in DOB variable. Save this fie with the name as of your Roll number, rn_68




2]	Create a list named ls. The list ls contains following 6 vectors with their values as follows :
Rollno- 1:4
First name- Ravi,Om,Ajay,Shiv
Last name-Dev,Gandhi,Pande,Rao
Subject-AE,DS,ML,OS
Marks-35,40,38,02
Result –P,P,P,F.  
Task To be performed:
1.	Print the list ls.
2.	Print all the independent element of list ls.
3.	Find the class of element of the list.
4.	What will be the output of the following commands:
What will be the output  for
a)	Print(ls[[2]][1])
b)	 print(ls[[4]][4])
c)	print(ls[5])
5.	It was found that the marks of Ajay were entered wrongly. The correct marks should be 45. Replace the marks of Ajay without disturbing the other elements or without loading the complete list again.
